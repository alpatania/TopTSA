Lately it has come more evident that there is a fast growing community of researchers working with topological tools in dynamical systems, signal theory and time series analysis. This is and attempt to put together resources in this field as i go through them.

An interesting new approach to dynamic state detection using persistent homology with ordinal networks and Takens' embedding for dynamyc state detection. The comparison with the standard Lyapunov exponent is interesting and might be interesting to be further developed.
